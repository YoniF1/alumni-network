# Alumni Network

This application is for alumni of educational institutions to make and maintain connections after the end of their course. Users will go through a initial wizard and fill in their personal details including the cohort or class they belonged to. The admin user will then have to approve their cohort request. Once approved, the user can post and see the other posts of people who were in the same cohort.
